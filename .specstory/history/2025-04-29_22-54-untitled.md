_**Assistant**_

I'll create a new project for you based on the standards you specified. Let me set up the structure for a Residence Manager application.

---

<details>
            <summary>Listed current directory • **9** results</summary>
        
| Name |
|-------|
| 📁 `.cursor` |
| 📁 `.git` |
| 📁 `history` |
| 📄 `.gitignore` |
| 📄 `.cursorindexingignore` |
| 📁 `.specstory` |
| 📁 `backend` |
| 📄 `backend.rar` |
| 📁 `frontend` |

</details>

I see we have a basic structure with `backend` and `frontend` directories. Let's explore them to see what we're working with.

<details>
            <summary>Listed directory backend • **22** results</summary>
        
| Name |
|-------|
| 📄 `ResidenceManager-Frontend.md` |
| 📁 `.git` |
| 📄 `.gitignore` |
| 📁 `ResidenceManagement.Test` |
| 📁 `ResidenceManagement.Tests` |
| 📁 `ResidenceManagement.Core` |
| 📁 `ResidenceManagement.Infrastructure` |
| 📄 `knowledge-base.md` |
| 📄 `hata-cozumleri.md` |
| 📁 `ResidenceManagement.Application` |
| 📁 `.cursor` |
| 📄 `CHANGELOG.md` |
| 📁 `projedetails` |
| 📄 `index.html` |
| 📁 `ResidenceManagement.API` |
| 📁 `tmp` |
| 📄 `contuniedocuments.rar` |
| 📄 `ResidenceManagement.sln` |
| 📄 `backend.sln` |
| 📁 `ResidenceManagement.Services` |
| 📄 `.cursorindexingignore` |
| 📁 `.specstory` |

</details>

<details>
            <summary>Listed directory frontend • **2** results</summary>
        
| Name |
|-------|
| 📁 `.git` |
| 📄 `README.md` |

</details>

I see that the project has already been started with a .NET solution following Clean Architecture principles (Core, Infrastructure, Application, API). The frontend directory appears to be mostly empty. Let's take a closer look at the solution structure and then decide on the next steps.
